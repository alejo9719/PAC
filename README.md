# PAC
(PUJ Artificial intelligence for videogames Course project)

This project consists on a Pac-Man clone built as the Artificial Intelligence for Videogames project on Pontificia Universidad Javeriana - Cali. It is currently under development and on an early stage.

It currently has 2 levels, the first one uses the A* algorithm combined with some special behavior for every enemy to make each of them smarter and the game more difficult to beat.

The second level is a "continuous" one, which implements flocking and different mechanics from the original game. This level does not use the A* algorithm, it simply calculates a vector from the leader enemy to the main character.
