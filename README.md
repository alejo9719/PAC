# PAC
(PUJ Artificial intelligence for videogames Course project)

This project consists on a Pac-Man clone built as the Artificial Intelligence for Videogames project on Pontificia Universidad Javeriana - Cali. It is currently under development and on an early stage.

The game uses the A* algorithm combined with some special behavior for every enemy to make each of them smarter and the game more difficult to beat.
